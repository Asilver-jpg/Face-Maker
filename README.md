# FaceMaker

This is an React application where users can create art using their faces.
Technologies:
1. ClmTrackr
2. React
3. Rails

The Rails backend for this application can be found at [here](https://github.com/Asilver-jpg/faceArt_backend), and MUST be run on port 3001 in order to function properly. 

If you don't want to make an account, simply type in Boblin as a username and click log in.

It should be mentioned that at the moment, the controls are very finicky so it may take some time to get used to. I recommend trying to keep your face about a foot or less away from the camera as distance plays a huge factor. Eventually, distance won't be an issue and the controls will be smoother. 

The video below details how to use the application more thoroughly.
